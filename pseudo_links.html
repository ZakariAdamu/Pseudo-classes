			Little Lemon is owned by two Italian brothers, Mario and Adrian, who moved
			to the United States to persue their shared dream of owning a restaurant.
			To craft the menu, Mario relies on family recipes and his experience as a
			chef in Italy. Adrian does all the marketing for the restaurant and led
			the effort to expand the menu beyond classic Italian to incorporate
			additional cuisines fron the mediterranian region.
